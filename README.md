A repository of machine learning algorithms built from scratch for learning purposes

## algorithms:
- SVM (Following Sentdex tutorial, Kernel taken from external source)
- NN (Based on 3Blue1Brown video series, Trained on MNIST)
- CNN (Using Stanford 231n + many other sources, Trained on Fashion-MNIST)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Following Sentdex tutorial, Wisconsin breast cancer dataset not included)
- Regression Algorithms (Following Sentdex tutorial, Logic correct but currently not executable)
